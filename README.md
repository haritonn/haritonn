## Hello there!
Hello, my name is Hariton and I'm a third-year student at Saratov State University, majoring in Fundamental Computer Science and Information Technology.
In addition to my studies, I enjoy learning something new about machine learning & deep learning.

Currently exploring:
- LLMs;
- NLP applications (sentiment analysis, text summarization, etc.);
- Also I'd like to dive into RAG systems.

## Other interests

Besides studying, I also love teaching. I am currently one of the leading lecturers at the machine learning club at [DSC](https://dsc.alivetech.org).
In this club, we talk about classic ML with an emphasis on supervised learning.
